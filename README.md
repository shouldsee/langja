# langja
A jinja2-like renderer powerer by LLM

- examples: see  [./langja/examples/](./langja/examples/)

### Feature
- LLM rendered: prompts to induce llm to render a structured output
  - [TODO] benchmark different llm for their performance in mimicking a jinja renderer
- [TODO] python rendered: prompts that only calls LLM when needed.
